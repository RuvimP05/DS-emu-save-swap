<h1>HOW TO USE</h1>
<Strong>*DISCLAIMER*</Strong><br>
THIS IS ONLY TO BE USED WITH WSL 2.0 WITH adb.exe BEING ACCESSED FROM WSL<br>
<br>
Build and move the binary to your /usr/bin/ folder and run.<br>
on setup, it will ask you for two directories, your phone directory, and your PC directory, make sure to enter these correctly (you can edit later in ~/.config/savswapds/config.json)
from there it is a simple process to choose the src/dest and pick the file you want to transfer.<br>
<br>

<h3>Dependencies</h3><br>
adb must be installed on your Windows host machine, and aliased in WSL 2.0 as adb.exe
